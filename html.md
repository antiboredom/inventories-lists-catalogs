## What's a website?

### HTML

HTML is "hypertext markup language". HTML is made up of a set of tags that define structure and meaning.

Here's what a basic html document might look like:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>A Spectre is Hauning Europe</title>
	</head>
	
	<body>
		<p>Greetings Comrade!</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Some tags wrap around other content (either text or other tags), and some tags exist on their own.

Some important tags:

```<html><html>```

```<p>I'm a paragraph</p>```

```<img src="trotsky.jpg">```

```<a href="http://pravda.ru">Click here!</a>```
